# QuarkNet Cosmic Ray Data
Code and data for cosmic ray muon flux analysis
The majority of the analysis is done in Jupyter Notebooks.
The data can be found in Angles directory with each angle measurement having its own directory. Addtionally, we combined all the measurements into the All directory for an overall analysis. The Calibration directory details the plateauing process.

Plots and analysis for the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.13689 can be found in the Plots/Paper directory. 

When citing this data, we refer users to cite the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.13689.
